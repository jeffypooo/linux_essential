## Linux Essential
A collection of shell scripts I've written over the years to accomplish common tasks.

### Sections
- `jetbrains_ide_launchers`
  - Jetbrains IDE's typically come as a standalone installtion launched via a script (ex: `clion.sh`). 
    These scripts will automatically detect IDE installations and launch them in the background with silenced output. 
    No more wasted terminal windows!
    
### Coming Soon (when I find them)
1. Provisioning scripts for CMake/C++, Android, and Node.js development machines
